# Mikado Method and Test Data Builders Kata

_A kata or a workshop to teach how to combine Test Data Builders and the Mikado
Method to add tests on a bug in a legacy codebase without freezing features_

Developers working on legacy code are always told to write tests before fixing 
any bug. In theory, it is very nice, but in practice, it is a lot more tricky!

We know we need to add tests, but itâ€™s easier said than done.  
In legacy codebase, just setting up the objects for the test is most often an 
unjustifiable nightmarish 2 weeks work. Mocks are a common workaround, but 
mocking legacy codebase usually makes them more difficult to change, not less!

In this hands-on pair programming dojo, you will learn how to combine the 
mikado method with test-data-builders to build a baby-step plan to add your
first test to a legacy codebase. You will also learn how to draw a graph of
nested test-data-builders so that you can instantiate test data, without mocks.

## What this is

This repository contains some code and instructions to guide you through fixing
and testing a bug in a legacy code base using test data builders and the mikado
method.

The workshop is expected to last for 2 hours and 30 minutes.

When you are done, you should have a good enough understanding of the concept
to start to use them in your daily work.

## Who is this for?

If you are a developer dealing with legacy code, it might a good idea to
practice this kata, alone or even better, with your team.

If you are a technical coach, you might host a session of this kata as a 
workshop with many developers.
