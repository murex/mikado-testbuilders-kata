That's all folks!

## Other Takeaways and important points

Test Data Builders and the Mikado Method are only some of the legacy-
refactoring techniques out there:

* [Golden Master Testing](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/surviving-legacy-code-with-golden-master-and-sampling)
  (or [Approval Testing](https://approvaltests.com/))
* [Strangler application](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html)
* [Bubble Context](http://domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettingStartedWithDDDWhenSurroundedByLegacySystemsV1.pdf)
  (or extracting an [Anti-Corruption Layer](https://dev.to/asarnaout/the-anti-corruption-layer-pattern-pcd))
 
We can combine most of them as we did today. These combinations are more
powerful than each technique used separately. This is the case where 

> 1 + 1 > 2

When we started to coach teams about refactoring, experience had taught us
that legacy code bases had to go through a long and painful refactoring phase 
before we could apply agile-coding practices like Test Driven Development.

We are now convinced that it is possible to jump into TDD much faster, in 
almost any code base, as long as you learn the skills.
