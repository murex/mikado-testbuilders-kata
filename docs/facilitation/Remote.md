These facilitation advices will work for a large audience of remote attendees.

## Training from the Back of the Room activities

Here is how you can adapt these activities for remote facilitation

### Icebreaker question energizer

People will need to mob for programming, so it's a good thing to get them to know each other a bit more with an energizer. Team building icebreaker questions make perfect remote energizer. [This page](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/08/the-25-best-icebreaker-questions-for-team-building-at-work/) contains 25 great questions.

### Self-study material

The material contains instructions, videos, and web centers. The goal is to have everyone, in any mob, be able to discover and learn the material at his own pace.

### Web centers

This collection of markdown files contains 2 'Web Centers':
* [Test Data Builders](./references/Test_Data_Builders.md)
* [The Mikado Method](./references/The_Mikado_Method.md)

These are web pages where attendees can look for clues as to how to get through the exercise.

If participants want to go deeper, they might also have a look at the [References](./references/References.md) page. 

### Mob programming

Mob programming is the simplest setup for a remote audience: use a unique driver and round-robin navigators. With this setup, only one person in the mob requires a working environment.

### Mini-Retros

Mini retros start with a simple question like "What worked well and what did not". In a remote setup, having an online board like Miro or Trello will help a lot. Here is how goes:

- in each mob
- everyone takes a few minutes to answer the questions, and fill the good / bad columns
- the mob discusses the tickets
- they can also have a look at the typical answers and at other insightful questions from the [Retrospective Guide](Retrospectives_Guide.md)
- more discussion...

### Takeaways as a Conclusion

A good way to conclude the workshop is to bring everyone together again, and ask them for main takeaways from everything they did. Again, an online board will help a lot. Here is how you can run this:

- Ask every mob to pick 1 key takeaway, and put them in the global takeaway board
- Bring everyone together in the main session
- Round rob through the mobs

## General Facilitation tips

### Use an online board

Nick Tune provides great advices about how to run effective workshops with Miro in [this post](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/organising-large-miro-boards-for-remote-workshops-abcf01bc2d8e).

It's simpler to use a single board for all the audience, and to duplicate working zones for each mob.

The nice thing about Miro is that it's versatile enough to handle both the mikado graphs and the retrospectives!

### Use online timers

In order to make sure to stick to the agenda, use shared online timers. Miro has a built-in timer feature that is very effective at managing a large remote audience.
