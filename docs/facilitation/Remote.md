These facilitation advices will work for a large audience of remote attendees.

## Training from the Back of the Room activities

Here is how you can adapt these activities for remote facilitation

### Icebreaker question energizer

People will need to mob for programming, so it's a good thing to get them to know each other a bit more with an energizer. Team building icebreaker questions make perfect remote energizer. [This page](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/08/the-25-best-icebreaker-questions-for-team-building-at-work/) contains 25 great questions.

### Self-study material

The material contains instructions, videos, and web centers. The goal is to have everyone, in any mob, be able to discover and learn the material at his own pace.

### Web centers

This collection of markdown files contains 2 'Web Centers':
* [Test Data Builders](./references/Test_Data_Builders.md)
* [The Mikado Method](./references/The_Mikado_Method.md)

These are web pages where attendees can look for clues as to how to get through the exercise.

If participants want to go deeper, they might also have a look at the [References](./references/References.md) page. 

### Mob programming

Mob programming is the simplest setup for a remote audience: use a unique driver and round-robin navigators. With this setup, only one person in the mob requires a working environment.

### Mini-Retros

Mini retros start with a simple question like "What worked well and what did not". In a remote setup, having an online board like Miro or Trello will help a lot. Here is what happens within each mob:

- Every mobster takes a few minutes to answer the questions, and fill the good / bad columns
- They react and discuss the tickets
- They can also have a look at the typical answers and at other insightful questions from the [Retrospective Guide](Retrospectives_Guide.md)
- Discussion can continue until the time is over

### Takeaways as a Conclusion

A good way to conclude the workshop is to bring everyone together again, and ask them for main takeaways from everything they did. Again, an online board will help a lot. Here is how you can run this:

- Ask every mob to pick 1 key takeaway, and put them in the global takeaway board
- Bring everyone together in the main session
- Round rob through the mobs

## Tool

Obviously, remote facilitation depends heavily on good tools. Here are the typical features that your tooling system should provide for a smooth workshop:

- [PRESENTATION] Video conference, where you can present to the whole audience
- [BREAKOUT] Video conference in breakout rooms, one for each mobs
- [SCREEN] Screen sharing, while you or the drivers present
- [JUMP] Quickly jump from one breakout room to the other
- [GRAPH] Mobs will need a shared tool to draw a mikado graph, like a mind map for example
- [RETRO] Run Retrospectives
- [HELP] Mobs will need to ask for help if they are blocked
- [NOTIFICATIONS] A chat system to share notifications and messages
- [COME-BACK] Send a 'blocking' message that attendees must see (Ex: when they should get back from mob to all-in work)
- [TIMER] Shared timers in order to cadence the mobs' work
- [MAP] It is nice to have a visual map of the path in the workshop

Here are best-practices for the different tools

### Miro tips [MAP] [GRAPH] [RETRO] [COME-BACK] [TIMER] [BREAKOUT]

Miro can deal with almost all the above points except Video conferencing. It's simpler to use a single board for all the audience, and to duplicate working zones for each mob. It's dead easy to setup retrospectives, energizers, and mind-maps in Miro.

#### Use an online board [MAP]

Nick Tune provides great advices about how to run effective workshops with Miro in [this post](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/organising-large-miro-boards-for-remote-workshops-abcf01bc2d8e).

#### Use online timers [TIMER]

Miro has a built-in shared timer agenda. Here is how you can use it:

- You don't need to set a timer when you are facilitating or presenting, just make sure to stick within the timebox. Ex: General introduction
- Add a timer for short activities. Ex: self-organizing into groups
- Add a long timer encompassing coding activities that follow each other like. Ex: understand your constraint + coding

#### Get everyone's attention [COME-BACK]

One rather intrusive way, but effective, way to get everyone's attention, and for example, to bring everyone back in the general session for the final retrospective, is to use Miro's 'Bring Every One to me'

#### Draw the breakout rooms on the board [BREAKOUT]

Miro can be very effective to build a self-organized breakout activity. You can also provide a link to the breakout room in your video conferencing system so that mobsters can easily jump in.

### [hopin.to](https://hopin.to) tips [PRESENTATION] [BREAKOUT] [SCREEN] [JUMP] [HELP] [NOTIFICATIONS]

Hopin.to is an remote openspace system. It features video conferencing, screensharing, breakout rooms and a chat system. It fits almost all our needs out of the box.

#### The main session chat [NOTIFICATIONS] [HELP]

Before mobs spread in their own sessions, tell them to keep their chat open on the main session. This will allow them to post requests for help on this chat, but it will also allow you to send general notifications to all the audience.
