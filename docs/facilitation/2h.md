# 2h Code Retreat Timetable

Here is a typical time table to make the workshop stick in 2 hours. With this length, we'll stick to the standard [code retreat format](https://www.coderetreat.org/getting-started/), but will only run 2 iterations. To maximize learning, we suggest:

* to let every mob or pair choose their favorite constraint in the second iteration
* to run an all-in retro at the end to foster interesting discussions

### 1 - Introduction (30 minutes)
