# 2h Code Retreat Time Table

Here is a typical time table to make the workshop stick in 2 hours. With this length, we'll stick to the standard code retreat format, but will only run 2 iterations. To maximize learning, we suggest:

* to let every mob or pair choose his favorite constraint in the second iteration
* to run an all-in retro at the end to foster interesting discussions

### 1 - Introduction (5 minutes)

| Phase | Style | Length | Start | End |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|-----|
| Present the learning goal | All-in | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| Energizer | Mobs | 3 | 2 | 5 |
	
### 2 - Easy Fix, Difficult Test (50 minutes)

| Phase | Style | Length | Start | End |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|-----|
| Present the code and the exercise | All-in | 10 | 5 | 15 |
| Reproduce the bugs and apply the fix | Mobs | 5 | 15 | 20
| Comment the fixes and write tests | Mobs | 30 | 20 | 50 |
| Mini retro | Mobs | 5 | 50 | 55 |
