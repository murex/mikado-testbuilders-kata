To ensure a smooth start of the workshop, we highly recommend that you have the 
dev environment configured on your machine before the training day.

This preparation process should only take few minutes from your time!

Follow the below steps to prepare your environment: 
1. Pick the programming language of your preference ([C++](../cpp), [Java](../java), or [C#](../csharp))
1. Follow the steps defined in the BUILD_MANUAL corresponding to your preferred
   language. These manuals contain information on the required tools, versions, 
   and processes to configure and run the project for the corresponding language.
    1. [C++ Build Manual](../cpp/BUILD_MANUAL.md)
    1. [Java Build Manual](../java/BUILD_MANUAL.md)
1. Your environment will be ready when you can: 
    1. Open, compile, and run tests from your IDE
    1. Run the application from the command-line (i.e., "Run Command" section of the BUILD_MANUAL)
1. If you face any issue, you can refer to the [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting.md) page.
