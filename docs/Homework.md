To ensure a smooth start of the workshop, we highly recommend that you go over 
the below two preparation steps before the training day.

This should only take few minutes of your time, but would save a lot of the 
workshop's time!  

## Configure Dev Environment 

Firstly, let's configure the dev environment on your machine.

Configuration Steps: 
1. Pick the programming language of your preference ([C++](../cpp), [Java](../java), or [C#](../csharp))
1. Follow the steps defined in the BUILD_MANUAL corresponding to your preferred
   language. These manuals contain information on the required tools, versions, 
   and processes to configure and run the project:
    1. [C++ Build Manual](../cpp/BUILD_MANUAL.md)
    1. [Java Build Manual](../java/BUILD_MANUAL.md)
1. Your environment will be ready when you can: 
    1. Open, compile, and run tests from your IDE
    1. Run the application from the command-line (i.e., "Run Command" section of the BUILD_MANUAL)
1. If you face any issue, you can refer to the [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting.md) page.
