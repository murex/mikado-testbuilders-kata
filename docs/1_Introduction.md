You'll need to collaborate a lot during this workshop, so let's get started
with an activity that will get you to know each other.

> Introduce yourself to a person seated next to you. Tell this person why you
> are here and what you want to learn from this workshop.

## Before we start! 

On a piece of paper, note down your 1 or 2 expectation(s) out of this workshop.

## Organization of this workshop

During this workshop, you'll first fix a bug in an existing, untested app and
try to add unit tests at the same time.

As this should prove difficult, we'll present how to combine 2 techniques, test
data builders and the mikado method, to add tests without stopping feature
delivery.

You'll be programming in pairs for most of the workshop.

You'll find links to 'Web Centers': web pages containing documentation and
references to important concepts in this workshop. If you are in a room, there
might also be 'Wall Centers' on the wall were you'll find similar information
and physical books.

Open the code in your favorite IDE:

* To work on the java version, simply load the root [pom.xml](../java/pom.xml) in 
  your favourite IDE
* We currently only have a Visual Studio environment around the C++ code (BTW,
  contributions are welcome :-)). Open [testbuilders-workshop.sln](../cpp/testbuilders-workshop.sln).

If you have problems compiling and running the code, check our [Troubleshooting guide](Troubleshooting.md)
