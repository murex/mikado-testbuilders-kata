You'll need to collaborate a lot during this workshop, so let's get started
with an activity that will get you to know each other.

> Introduce yourself to a person seated next to you. Tell this person why you
> are here and what you want to learn from this workshop.

## Before we start! 

On a piece of paper, note down your 1 or 2 expectation(s) out of this workshop.

## Organization of this workshop

During this workshop, you'll be working on a codebase where 2 bugs just got fixed without adding a test first. You've been tasked to write the unit tests covering the fixes. 

As this should prove difficult, we'll present how to combine 2 techniques, test
data builders and the mikado method, to add tests without stopping feature
delivery.

You'll be programming in mob or pairs for most of the workshop.

You'll find links to "***Web Centers***": web pages containing documentation and
references to important concepts in this workshop. If you are in a room, there
might also be 'Wall Centers' on the wall were you'll find similar information
and physical books.

You'll find a "***Build Manual***" for each of the supported languages. Those manuals
will help you compile, run and load the project in your favorite IDE:
* [Java Build Manual](../java/BUILD_MANUAL.md)
* [CPP Build Manual](../cpp/BUILD_MANUAL.md)

If you have problems compiling and running the code, check our [Troubleshooting guide](Troubleshooting.md)
