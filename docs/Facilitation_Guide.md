Here is information to run this workshop.


## Time Table

Here are 2 agendas that you can use to run this workshop:

* [2h code retreat](./facilitation/2h.md)
* [2h30](./facilitation/2h30.md)

## Pedagogy

We are trying to maximize self-learning as much as possible in this workshop.
That's why there is a lot of time reserved for coding. We also borrowed
techniques from [Training from the Back of the Room](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8141935-training-from-the-back-of-the-room)

### Turn and talk Energizer

People will need to mob for programming, so it's a good icebreaker to get them
to meet and discuss the topic at the beginning

### Rapid Response during Lectures

After presenting the Test Data Builders and the Mikado Method, we'll ask some
questions to the attendees to check their understanding. It will also help them
to assess what they learned after programming.

### Wall and Web centers

This collection of markdown files contains 2 'Web Centers':
* [Test Data Builders](./references/Test_Data_Builders.md)
* [The Mikado Method](./references/The_Mikado_Method.md)

These are web pages where attendees can look for clues as to how to get through
the exercise.

If you are running the workshop in a room, you can create physical Wall Centers
with real copies of books, and printouts of articles. All referenced books and 
articles are listed under the [References](./references/References.md) page. 

### Mob or pair programming

Will act as a kind of 'Paired Teach Back' activity all along.

### Stand and Talk for Mini-Retros

Mini retros start by asking a simple question like "What worked well and what
did not". This will make the attendees think before they can state their answer
in front of all the class. Following on with other insightful questions will
help them to envision how to use their new knowledge.

[Here](Retrospectives_Guide.md) is a dedicated page with typical retro summaries.

### Learning logs as a Conclusion

By writing down what they think they can do with their new knowledge, attendees
have a higher chance of actually using it in their daily work.

## General Facilitation tips

### Do a live demo of the mikado beginning for large audience

If attendees are remote, or only a single mob, letting them watch the video is fine. If they are all in the same room though, you'll get a chaos of unsynchronized replays...

We could also just watch it through the main screen

### Use wide visible timers

The workshop follows a particular narrative. It is very important to stick to the agenda. Time lost at the beginning is eventually taken from the last activity, which is where people finally 'get' the power of Test Data Builders + Mikado Method.

In order to make sure to stick to the agenda, use wide visible timer in the room. Time-boxing is preferred way to go. Activities don't rely on the code written previously, so people can start the next activity even if they did not finished the previous one.
